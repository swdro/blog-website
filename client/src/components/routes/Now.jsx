                &emsp;&emsp;I will continue to post software related blogs
                as I tackle more projects with fresh problems.
                Since performing thorough research and creating an 
                entire article regarding a topic may be time consuming,
                there is no fixed schedule for these blog posts. Instead
                I will try my best to post as often as I can as it is
                beneficial both to me and the reader. Keep in mind  
                <strong> these posts are not the end all be all of 
                the topic they encapsulate</strong>. I am human at
                the end of the day, thus I make mistakes. Also keep into
                consideration that at the time of creating this website, 
                I am relatively new to the field of software. I have a long
                way to go and if I make a mistake feel free to redirect me.

                &emsp;&emsp;The current status of my software engineering journey
                is I am unemployed for the time being. I did just graduate 
                university in August so I expect to find some form of work very 
                soon. For the time being I will continue to experiment and work 
                on projects for myself.

                With that being said. Thank you for visiting the website and 
                feel free to make yourself at home (:
